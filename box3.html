        <p>The past couple of years have seen a tremendous surge in the global pulp market, with prices hovering around record highs in major regions such as North America and Europe. The reasons behind these inflated prices are primarily reduced timber harvests and a decrease in sawmill residues, resulting in a tightened wood fiber supply. </p>
        <h2 style="color:rgb(48, 5, 88)">The Importance of Wood Fiber in the Pulp Industry</h2>
        <p>The fluctuating prices in the hardwood fiber markets can primarily be attributed to the boycott of European imports of hardwood logs from Russia following the country's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This development, combined with increased demand for Eucalyptus pulp logs in Brazil, has significantly impacted the market dynamics. Climatic factors and seasonal difficulties in harvesting lower-quality hardwood stands have also played a part in inflating the prices. </p>
        <p style="font-size:145%;color:rgb(18, 82, 97)"><strong>Understanding Market Movements</strong></p>
        <p>The Global Hardwood Fiber Price Index (HFPI), which tracks wood fiber prices across continents, witnessed a significant surge of 24% over the past two years. Interestingly, the North American region stood as an exception during this period, with prices actually falling. </p>
        <p>A similar trend was observed in the Softwood Fiber Price Index (SFPI), which declined in late 2023 and early 2024 due to the drop in the cost of softwood pulplogs and wood chips. This was driven mainly by market dynamics in North America and Central Europe. </p>
