        <p>Back in September 2023 we announced our new approach to how we consult or seek advice and information on forestry proposals. This published statement set out how the Forestry Commission, on behalf of the Forestry Commissioners, will undertake consultation when assessing applications for woodland creation, tree felling and management.  

            These changes will deliver efficient decision making and accelerate application processing times. They will simplify evidence gathering for forestry proposals and avoid duplication, whilst still adhering to other environmental legislation and good practice guidelines.  </p>
        <p>We are pleased to advise that the first phase for implementing this new approach (phase 1a and 1b see table below) will be implemented today (26 February 2024). This will include the shortening of the consultation public register timescales from 28 days to 21 days, and only seeking advice and information from non-statutory consultees when necessary. </p>
        <h2 style="color:darkgoldenrod">What do these changes mean?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>From Monday 26 February 2024, we will undertake consultation only when there is a statutory or mandatory requirement to do so. The Forestry Commission will engage with other stakeholders when we  identify the need for it, for example, to gather more information, advice, or clarity </li>
            <li>There is no change to the underlying protections, constraints, and interests across England, or to any of the organisations responsible for them. For those sites or features where there is a statutory requirement to consult, the Forestry Commission will still do so, in line with relevant legislation  </li>
            <li>All consultation undertaken after 26 February 2024 (regardless of when the application was received) will adopt the new approach whereby the Forestry Commission will only seek advice and information from non-statutory consultees where necessary </li>
            <li>For proposals where consultation commenced before 26 February 2024, we will continue using the old approach</li>
            <li>All proposals that were listed on the consultation public register before 26 February 2024 will run for 28 days. Any proposals input on the public register after 26 February will run for 21 days </li>
       </ul>
       <h2 style="color:firebrick">Where can I find out more? </h2>
       <p>The changes to the consultation approach are outlined in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/forestry-commissioners-statement-on-consultation-procedures-for-forestry-applications">the Forestry Commissioners' statement on consultation procedures for forestry applications.</a></p>
       <p><a href="https://forestrycommission.blog.gov.uk/2023/09/18/the-forestry-commissions-new-approach-to-consultation-on-forestry-applications/">Our previous blog published on the 18 September 2023 on the Forestry Commission’s new approach to consultation on forestry applications</a>, sets out our commitment to using existing ways of working until our internal guidance and business processes had been reviewed and amended .</p>
       <h2 style="color:green">When will these changes be made?</h2>
       <p>The Forestry Commission will roll out the revised approach over the coming months, further announcements will be made as these changes are introduced. These changes will be implemented using a phased approach.</p>
