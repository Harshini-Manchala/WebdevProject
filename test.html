          <h2>FORESTS</h2>
          <p>
            Forests in India are very diverse in their composition with a long evolutionary and geological history, occurring under diverse climatic and edaphic conditions. The forests represent a very unique assemblage of both Indo-Malayan and Australian species indicating the geological and paleo-botanical value of these forests.
             The diversity of Indian forests is a reflection of the country's varied topography and climate.  In the Western Ghats, lush tropical rainforests teem with life, while the deciduous forests of central India provide a canvas for the mesmerizing spectacle of the changing seasons. Along the coasts, the unique mangrove forests, such as the Sundarbans, provide protection from coastal erosion and support a rich web of life.

          <h2>ANIMALS</h2>
          <p>
            India's wildlife is as diverse as its culture. From the majestic Bengal tigers roaming in the Sundarbans to the elegant Indian elephants found in the forests of Kerala, this country is home to an incredible array of creatures. Indian wildlife also includes unique species like the Asiatic lions, found only in the Gir Forest, and the elusive snow leopards of the Himalayas.
            The Indian Elephant, revered in Indian culture and mythology, is another iconic species. These gentle giants are integral to India's forest ecosystems, helping to maintain the ecological balance.
            Snow Leopards, elusive and majestic, roam the high altitudes of the Himalayas. Their presence is indicative of the health of the high-altitude ecosystem.
            The One-horned Rhinoceros, primarily found in the grasslands of Assam, is unique to the Indian subcontinent.

          <h2>BIRDS</h2>
          <p>
            India is home to over 1300 species of birds that thrive in the widely diverse habitats of the country. It is one of the 17 megadiverse nations, with 21.71% of the country covered in forests. The national bird of India is the Indian peafowl, the male of which is one of the most beautiful birds in the world.The Indian Peafowl, also known as the common or blue peafowl, is a species native to the Indian subcontinent. It has since been introduced to many other countries around the world.
            Males are referred to as peacocks and females are called peahens, although both sexes can be colloquially referred to simply as “peacock”.
            These birds display sex-specific differences in coloration; males show off their iridescent feathers in shades of green and blues, while female plumage tends towards more muted browns with red accents on their tail feathers.
